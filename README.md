# Django Rest Multitoken

Implementation of [Django Rest Framework token authentication](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#tokenauthentication) that maintains multiple tokens for each user.

Currently the project is under heavy development. It was extracted from [djoser](https://github.com/sunscrapers/djoser) library. Working version is [available here](https://github.com/sunscrapers/djoser/tree/custom-auth-token).
